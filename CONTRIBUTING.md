# Contributing to LinearOperator

Thanks for contributing!

## Development installation

To get the development installation with all the necessary dependencies for
linting, testing, and building the documentation, run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cornellius-gp/linear_operator.git
cd linear_operator
pip install -e .[dev,test]
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```


## Our Development Process

### Formatting and Linting

LinearOperator uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) for code formatting
and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting.
This enforces a common code style across the repository.
The [development installation instructions](#development-installation) should install both tools, and no additional configuration should be necessary.

`flake8` and `pre-commit` are both run every time you make a local commit.
To run both commands independent of making a commit:
```bash
SKIP=flake8 pre-commit run --files test/**/*.py linear_operator/**/*.py
flake8
```

### Docstrings
We use [standard sphinx docstrings](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html) (not Google-style).


### Type Hints

LinearOperator aims to be fully typed using Python 3.8+
[type hints](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).
We expect any contributions to also use proper type annotations.
We are using [jaxtyping](https://github.com/google/jaxtyping) to help us be declarative about the dimension sizes used
in the LinearOperator methods.
The use of [jaxtyping](https://github.com/google/jaxtyping)  makes it clearer what the functions are doing algebraically
and where broadcasting is happening.

These type hints are checked in the unit tests by using
[typeguard](https://github.com/agronholm/typeguard) to perform run-time
checking of the signatures to make sure they are accurate.
The signatures are written into the base linear operator class in `_linear_oparator.py`.
These signatures are then copied to the derived classes by running the script
`python ./.hooks/propagate_type_hints.py`.
This is done for:
1. Consistency. Make sure the derived implementations are following the promised interface.
2. Visibility. Make it easy to see what the expected signature is, along with dimensions. Repeating the signature in the derived classes enhances readability.
3. Necessity. The way that jaxtyping and typeguard are written, they won't run type checks unless type annotations are present in the derived method signature.

In short, if you want to update the type hints, update the code in the LinearOperator class in
`_linear_oparator.py` then run `python ./.hooks/propagate_type_hints.py` to copy the new signature to the derived
classes.

### Unit Tests

#### With type checking (slower, but more thorough)
To run the unittests with type checking, run
```bash
pytest --jaxtyping-packages=linear_operator,typeguard.typechecked
```

- To run tests within a specific directory, run (e.g.) `pytest test/operators --jaxtyping-packages=linear_operator,typeguard.typechecked`.
- To run a specific file, run (e.g.) `pytest test/operators/test_matmul_linear_operator.py --jaxtyping-packages=linear_operator,typeguard.typechecked`.

#### Without type checking (faster, but less thorough)
We use python's `unittest` to run unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest
```

- To run tests within a specific directory, run (e.g.) `python -m unittest discover -s test/operators`.
- To run a specific unit test, run (e.g.) `python -m unittest test.operators.test_matmul_linear_operator.TestMatmulLinearOperator.test_matmul_vec`.



### Documentation

LinearOperator uses sphinx to generate documentation, and ReadTheDocs to host documentation.
To build the documentation locally, ensure that sphinx and its plugins are properly installed (see the [development installation section](#development-installation) for instructions).
Then run:

```baseh
cd docs
make html
cd build/html
python -m http.server 8000
```

The documentation will be available at http://localhost:8000.
You will have to rerun the `make html` command every time you wish to update the docs.

## Pull Requests
We greatly appreciate PRs! To minimze back-and-forward communication, please ensure that your PR includes the following:

1. **Code changes.** (the bug fix/new feature/updated documentation/etc.)
1. **Unit tests.** If you are updating any code, you should add an appropraite unit test.
   - If you are fixing a bug, make sure that there's a new unit test that catches the bug.
     (I.e., there should be a new unit test that fails before your bug fix, but passes after your bug fix.
     This ensures that we don't have any accidental regressions in the code base.)
   - If you are adding a new feature, you should add unit tests for this new feature.
1. **Documentation.** Any new objects/methods should have [appropriate docstrings](#docstrings).
   - If you are adding a new object, **please ensure that it appears in the documentation.**
     You may have to add the object to the appropriate file in [docs/source](https://github.com/cornellius-gp/linear_operator/tree/main/docs/source).

Before submitting a PR, ensure the following:
1. **Code is proprerly formatted and linted.** Linting and formatting checking should happen automatically if you have followed the development installation instructions.
   See [the formatting and linting](#formatting-and-linting) section for more info.
1. **Unit tests pass.** See [the unit tests section](#unit-tests) for more info.
1. **Documentation renders correctly.** [Build the documentation locally](#documentation) to ensure that your new class/docstrings are rendered correctly. Ensure that sphinx can build the documentation without warnings.


## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

We accept the following types of issues:
- Bug reports
- Requests for documentation/examples
- Feature requests
- Opportuntities to refactor code
- Performance issues (speed, memory, etc.)

Please refrain from using the issue tracker for questions or debugging personal code.
Instead please use the [LinearOperator discussions forum](https://github.com/cornellius-gp/linear_operator/discussions).
