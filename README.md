## Why LinearOperator
Before describing what linear operators are and why they make a useful abstraction, it's easiest to see an example.
Let's say you wanted to compute a matrix solve:

$$\boldsymbol A^{-1} \boldsymbol b.$$

If you didn't know anything about the matrix $\boldsymbol A$, the simplest (and best) way to accomplish this in code is:

```python
# A = torch.randn(1000, 1000)
# b = torch.randn(1000)
torch.linalg.solve(A, b)  # computes A^{-1} b
```

While this is easy, the `solve` routine is $\mathcal O(N^3)$, which gets very slow as $N$ grows large.

However, let's imagine that we knew that $\boldsymbol A$ was equal to a low rank matrix plus a diagonal
(i.e. $\boldsymbol A = \boldsymbol C \boldsymbol C^\top + \boldsymbol D$
for some skinny matrix $\boldsymbol C$ and some diagonal matrix $\boldsymbol D$.)
There's now a very efficient $\boldsymbol O(N)$ routine to compute $\boldsymbol A^{-1}$ (the [Woodbury formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_matrix_identity)).
**In general**, if we know that $\boldsymbol A$ has structure,
we want to use efficient linear algebra routines - rather than the general routines -
that exploit this structure.


### Without LinearOperator

Implementing the efficient solve that exploits $\boldsymbol A$'s low-rank-plus-diagonal structure would look something like this:

```python
def low_rank_plus_diagonal_solve(C, d, b):
    # A = C C^T + diag(d)
    # A^{-1} b = D^{-1} b - D^{-1} C (I + C^T D^{-1} C)^{-1} C^T D^{-1} b
    #   where D = diag(d)

    D_inv_b = b / d
    D_inv_C = C / d.unsqueeze(-1)
    eye = torch.eye(C.size(-2))
    return (
        D_inv_b - D_inv_C @ torch.cholesky_solve(
            C.mT @ D_inv_b,
            torch.linalg.cholesky(eye + C.mT @ D_inv_C, upper=False),
            upper=False
        )
    )


# C = torch.randn(1000, 20)
# d = torch.randn(1000)
# b = torch.randn(1000)
low_rank_plus_diagonal_solve(C, d, b)  # computes A^{-1} b in O(N) time, instead of O(N^3)
```

While this is efficient code, it's not ideal for a number of reasons:
1. It's a lot more complicated than `torch.linalg.solve(A, b)`.
2. There's no object that represents $\boldsymbol A$.
   To perform any math with $\boldsymbol A$, we have to pass around the matrix `C` and the vector `d`.


### With LinearOperator

The LinearOperator package offers the best of both worlds:

```python
from linear_operator.operators import DiagLinearOperator, LowRankRootLinearOperator
# C = torch.randn(1000, 20)
# d = torch.randn(1000)
# b = torch.randn(1000)
A = LowRankRootLinearOperator(C) + DiagLinearOperator(d)  # represents C C^T + diag(d)
```

it provides an interface that lets us treat $\boldsymbol A$ as if it were a generic tensor,
using the standard PyTorch API:

```python
torch.linalg.solve(A, b)  # computes A^{-1} b efficiently!
```

Under-the-hood, the `LinearOperator` object keeps track of the algebraic structure of $\boldsymbol A$ (low rank plus diagonal)
and determines the most efficient routine to use (the Woodbury formula).
This way, we can get a efficient $\mathcal O(N)$ solve while abstracting away all of the details.

Crucially, $\boldsymbol A$ is never explicitly instantiated as a matrix, which makes it possible to scale
to very large operators without running out of memory:

```python
# C = torch.randn(10000000, 20)
# d = torch.randn(10000000)
# b = torch.randn(10000000)
A = LowRankRootLinearOperator(C) + DiagLinearOperator(d)  # represents a 10M x 10M matrix!
torch.linalg.solve(A, b)  # computes A^{-1} b efficiently!
```

## What is a Linear Operator?
A linear operator is a generalization of a matrix.
It is a linear function that is defined in by its application to a vector.
The most common linear operators are (potentially structured) matrices,
where the function applying them to a vector are (potentially efficient)
matrix-vector multiplication routines.

In code, a `LinearOperator` is a class that
1. specifies the tensor(s) needed to define the LinearOperator,
1. specifies a `_matmul` function (how the LinearOperator is applied to a vector),
1. specifies a `_size` function (how big is the LinearOperator if it is represented as a matrix, or batch of matrices), and
1. specifies a `_transpose_nonbatch` function (the adjoint of the LinearOperator).
1. (optionally) defines other functions (e.g. `logdet`, `eigh`, etc.) to accelerate computations for which efficient sturcture-exploiting routines exist.

For example:

```python
class DiagLinearOperator(linear_operator.LinearOperator):
    r"""
    A LinearOperator representing a diagonal matrix.
    """
    def __init__(self, diag):
        # diag: the vector that defines the diagonal of the matrix
        self.diag = diag

    def _matmul(self, v):
        return self.diag.unsqueeze(-1) * v

    def _size(self):
        return torch.Size([*self.diag.shape, self.diag.size(-1)])

    def _transpose_nonbatch(self):
        return self  # Diagonal matrices are symmetric

    # this function is optional, but it will accelerate computation
    def logdet(self):
        return self.diag.log().sum(dim=-1)
# ...

D = DiagLinearOperator(torch.tensor([1., 2., 3.])
# Represents the matrix
#   [[1., 0., 0.],
#    [0., 2., 0.],
#    [0., 0., 3.]]
torch.matmul(D, torch.tensor([4., 5., 6.])
# Returns [4., 10., 18.]
```

While `_matmul`, `_size`, and `_transpose_nonbatch` might seem like a limited set of functions,
it turns out that most functions on the `torch` and `torch.linalg` namespaces can be efficiently implemented
using only these three primitative functions.

Moreover, because `_matmul` is a linear function, it is very easy to compose linear operators in various ways.
For example: adding two linear operators (`SumLinearOperator`) just requires adding the output of their `_matmul` functions.
This makes it possible to define very complex compositional structures that still yield efficient linear algebraic routines.

Finally, `LinearOperator` objects can be composed with one another, yielding new `LinearOperator` objects and automatically keeping track of algebraic structure after each computation.
As a result, users never need to reason about what efficient linear algebra routines to use  (so long as the input elements defined by the user encode known input structure).

## Use Cases

There are several use cases for the LinearOperator package.
Here we highlight two general themes:

### Modular Code for Structured Matrices

For example, let's say that you have a generative model that involves
sampling from a high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian.
This sampling operation will require storing and manipulating a large covariance matrix,
so to speed things up you might want to experiment with different structured
approximations of that covariance matrix.
This is easy with the LinearOperator package.

```python
from gpytorch.distributions import MultivariateNormal

# variance = torch.randn(10000)
cov = DiagLinearOperator(variance)
# or
# cov = LowRankRootLinearOperator(...) + DiagLinearOperator(...)
# or
# cov = KroneckerProductLinearOperator(...)
# or
# cov = ToeplitzLinearOperator(...)
# or
# ...

mvn = MultivariateNormal(torch.zeros(cov.size(-1), cov) # 10000-dimensional MVN
mvn.rsample()  # returns a 10000-dimensional vector
```

### Efficient Routines for Complex Operators

Many of the efficient linear algebra routines in LinearOperator are iterative algorithms
based on matrix-vector multiplication.
Since matrix-vector multiplication obeys many nice compositional properties
it is possible to obtain efficient routines for extremely complex compositional LienarOperators:

```python
from linear_operator.operators import KroneckerProductLinearOperator, RootLinearOperator, ToeplitzLinearOperator

# mat1 = 200 x 200 PSD matrix
# mat2 = 100 x 100 PSD matrix
# vec3 = 20000 vector

A = KroneckerProductLinearOperator(mat1, mat2) + RootLinearOperator(ToeplitzLinearOperator(vec3))
# represents a 20000 x 20000 matrix

torch.linalg.solve(A, torch.randn(20000))  # Sub O(N^3) routine!
```


<!-- docs_usecases_end -->
<!-- docs_using_start -->


## Using LinearOperator Objects

LinearOperator objects share (mostly) the same API as `torch.Tensor` objects.
Under the hood, these objects use `__torch_function__` to dispatch all efficient linear algebra operations
to the `torch` and `torch.linalg` namespaces.
This includes
- `torch.add`
- `torch.cat`
- `torch.clone`
- `torch.diagonal`
- `torch.dim`
- `torch.div`
- `torch.expand`
- `torch.logdet`
- `torch.matmul`
- `torch.numel`
- `torch.permute`
- `torch.prod`
- `torch.squeeze`
- `torch.sub`
- `torch.sum`
- `torch.transpose`
- `torch.unsqueeze`
- `torch.linalg.cholesky`
- `torch.linalg.eigh`
- `torch.linalg.eigvalsh`
- `torch.linalg.solve`
- `torch.linalg.svd`

Each of these functions will either return a `torch.Tensor`, or a new `LinearOperator` object,
depending on the function.
For example:

```python
# A = RootLinearOperator(...)
# B = ToeplitzLinearOperator(...)
# d = vec

C = torch.matmul(A, B)  # A new LienearOperator representing the product of A and B
torch.linalg.solve(C, d)  # A torch.Tensor
```

For more examples, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/cornellius-gp/linear_operator/blob/main/examples/).

### Batch Support and Broadcasting

`LinearOperator` objects operate naturally in batch mode.
For example, to represent a batch of 3 `100 x 100` diagonal matrices:

```python
# d = torch.randn(3, 100)
D = DiagLinearOperator(d)  # Reprents an operator of size 3 x 100 x 100
```

These objects fully support broadcasted operations:

```python
D @ torch.randn(100, 2)  # Returns a tensor of size 3 x 100 x 2

D2 = DiagLinearOperator(torch.randn([2, 1, 100]))  # Represents an operator of size 2 x 1 x 100 x 100
D2 + D  # Represents an operator of size 2 x 3 x 100 x 100
```

### Indexing

`LinearOperator` objects can be indexed in ways similar to torch Tensors. This includes:
- Integer indexing (get a row, column, or batch)
- Slice indexing (get a subset of rows, columns, or batches)
- LongTensor indexing (get a set of individual entries by index)
- Ellipses (support indexing operations with arbitrary batch dimensions)

```python
D = DiagLinearOperator(torch.randn(2, 3, 100))  # Represents an operator of size 2 x 3 x 100 x 100
D[-1]  # Returns a 3 x 100 x 100 operator
D[..., :10, -5:]  # Returns a 2 x 3 x 10 x 5 operator
D[..., torch.LongTensor([0, 1, 2, 3]), torch.LongTensor([0, 1, 2, 3])]  # Returns a 2 x 3 x 4 tensor
```

### Composition and Decoration
LinearOperators can be composed with one another in various ways.
This includes
- Addition (`LinearOpA + LinearOpB`)
- Matrix multiplication (`LinearOpA @ LinearOpB`)
- Concatenation (`torch.cat([LinearOpA, LinearOpB], dim=-2)`)
- Kronecker product (`torch.kron(LinearOpA, LinearOpB)`)

In addition, there are many ways to "decorate" LinearOperator objects.
This includes:
- Elementwise multiplying by constants (`torch.mul(2., LinearOpA)`)
- Summing over batches (`torch.sum(LinearOpA, dim=-3)`)
- Elementwise multiplying over batches (`torch.prod(LinearOpA, dim=-3)`)

See the documentation for a [full list of supported composition and decoration operations](https://linear-operator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/composition_decoration_operators.html).
